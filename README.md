This code implements a simple neural network with one hidden layer using the sigmoid activation function. The network is trained on a simple dataset of inputs and expected outputs and then tested on new inputs.

The neural network model is defined using a NeuralNetwork class. The weights of the network are stored in a 2D array weights. The init() method initializes the weights with some default values.

The feedForward(inputs:) method takes an array of input values and returns the output of the neural network for those inputs. It does this by first computing the dot product of the weights and the inputs using the dotProduct(_:_:) method and then passing the result through the sigmoid activation function using the sigmoid(_:) method.

The train(inputs:target:learningRate:) method takes an array of input values, a target output value, and a learning rate as input. It first computes the output of the network for the given inputs using the feedForward(inputs:) method. It then computes the error between the target output and the actual output. Finally, it updates the weights of the network using the error and the learning rate.

The sigmoid(_:) method implements the sigmoid activation function, which is used to squash the output of the network between 0 and 1.

The dotProduct(_:_:) method computes the dot product of a 2D array and a 1D array.

The neural network is trained on a simple dataset dataset consisting of four input-output pairs.

The network is tested on three new inputs, and the output of the network is compared to the expected output. The output is printed to the console along with the expected output.
